# TicTacToe
This is a React application that allows two players to play TicTacToe. It is a class project for the MIT Emeritus coding bootcamp.  

To Play: 
Load the standalone.html file to a server and click on any of the nine squares in the grid to select it as either "x" or "o".  Every time a square is selected, it will re-render to switch players so there will be alternating "x" and "o" markings.  The first h1 element displays who's turn it is, and the second declares the winner. 

RoadMap For Future Improvements: 
Re-do pallette so the colors are more appealing and the text is more visible.  Set the Player Names to match the assigned colors by adding additional ternary operators.
