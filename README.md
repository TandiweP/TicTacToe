# TicTacToe
This is a React application that allows two players to play TicTacToe. It is a class project for the MIT Emeritus coding bootcamp.  

To Play: 

Load the standalone.html file to a server and click on any of the nine squares in the grid to select it as either "x" or "o".  Every time a square is selected, it will re-render to switch players so there will be alternating "x" and "o" markings.  The first h1 element displays who's turn it is, and the second declares the winner.
